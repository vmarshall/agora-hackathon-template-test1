# {{event.name}} - Judging Rubric

## Overview

This rubric provides a structured framework for evaluating hackathon submissions. Each project will be scored across multiple categories on a scale of 1-5, with specific criteria for each score level.

## Scoring Categories

{% for criterion in judging_criteria %}

### {{criterion.weight}}%. {{criterion.name}}

_{{criterion.description}}_

| 4     | Very good implementation   |
| 3     | Good implementation        |
| 2     | Basic implementation       |
| 1     | Poor implementation        |

{% endfor %}

## Final Score Calculation

- Each category score (1-5) is multiplied by its percentage weight
- The weighted scores are summed to calculate the final score (maximum 5 points)
- One bonus point may be added for teams that effectively use additional Agora technologies

## Feedback Section

For each submission, judges should provide:

1. **Strengths**: Key positive aspects of the project
2. **Areas for Improvement**: Constructive feedback on how the project could be enhanced
3. **Additional Comments**: Any other relevant observations or suggestions
